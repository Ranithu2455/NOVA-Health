# NOVA Health 🩺
## AGI-Powered Personal Health Intelligence Companion
NOVA Health is an AGI-inspired personal health intelligence platform designed to bring different types of health and lifestyle information into one unified system.
Instead of processing medical records, prescriptions, nutrition, wearable data, sleep, mood, symptoms, and environmental information separately, NOVA Health uses a centralized **Health Intelligence Engine** to maintain context, identify relationships between different health factors, and provide personalized, context-aware health assistance.
> **Note:** NOVA Health demonstrates AGI-inspired and agentic reasoning principles for healthcare assistance. It does not attempt to create true human-level AGI.
---
## 🎯 Project Goals
The main goal of NOVA Health is to develop an intelligent healthcare assistant capable of:
- Integrating heterogeneous health and lifestyle data
- Maintaining a continuously updated personal health context
- Reasoning across multiple health domains
- Providing personalized health insights and recommendations
- Processing medical documents and images
- Monitoring medication, nutrition, sleep, mood, and activity
- Integrating supported wearable health data
- Providing context-aware notifications and reminders
- Generating daily and long-term health insights

## 🧠 AGI Health Intelligence Engine
The **Health Intelligence Engine** is the central intelligence component of NOVA Health.
It combines information from multiple sources into a unified health context.

🧩 Health Context

NOVA Health uses a common structure to allow different modules to communicate with the Health Intelligence Engine.

HealthEvent
├── timestamp
├── type
├── source
├── value
├── unit
├── confidence
└── metadata

Example:

Type: Heart Rate
Value: 82
Unit: bpm
Source: Smart Watch
Timestamp: 2026-09-24 08:30

This structure allows information from different domains to be combined into a unified health context.
