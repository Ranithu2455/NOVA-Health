## 7. Rules for the Team

1. Do not change an endpoint without updating this file and telling the team.
2. Backend implements these paths exactly. Mobile builds against them.
3. Until the backend is ready, mobile uses mock responses that match the examples above.
4. Every endpoint (except register and login) checks the token and returns only the current user's data.
5. Never put real personal health data in examples, tests, or commits.
6. AI-generated output (scan results, assistant replies, reports) is guidance, not a medical diagnosis. The app must show a disclaimer.

## 8. Open Questions

1. Final database choice and ID format (owner: database design).
2. Does the AI engine run as a separate service or as a module inside the backend?
3. Rate limits for the AI endpoints.
4. Image storage: keep the original image or delete it after scanning?
